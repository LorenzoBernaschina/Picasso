## Instructions for playing
When you launch the game three buttons will appear on the left side of the screen.
Tap on one of them to reproduce the corresponding shape.
You can add as many different shapes as you wish.
If you tap twice on a shape, you get access to an Inspector for changing color, zPosition, size and rotation or even for deleting.
Once you have set your shape, drag it with the mouse to change its position on the screen and assemble it with others to make more complex figures.
Moreover if you tap on a blank space and drag, you can select multiple shapes and move them all together.
In addition, you can personalize the colors from the given palette or making them yourself by moving on the RGB lines.

## Technical requirements
The game was made in Swift Playground using Xcode 8.2.1
